For next week, please complete the first 2 modules:
'Basic Concepts'
'Conditionals and Loops'




The code prompt for the week was:
	Write code to convert a given number into words. For example, if “34” is given as input, output should be “thirty four”.  Only code for numbers from -999 to 999.

	Examples:
	input: 34  -> output: "thirty four"
	input: -90 -> output: "negative ninety"
	input: 001 -> output: "one"
	input: 10  -> output: "ten"
	input: 999 -> output: "nine hundred ninety nine"
