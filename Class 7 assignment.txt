Since I could not get the information around adding OAuth2, the only homework for this week is as follows:

Make sure hw6 is finished and turned in
Make sure you have a wireframe of what your landing page should look like for you personal site
Make sure the solution for your personal site has a _testBootstrap page that contains your template you've chosen to start with
Continue working on completing your personal site, you should be able to do everything on it except the web API end point

If you have any SoloLearn modules left, please make sure you complete a module and take a screenshot for your homework folder.
